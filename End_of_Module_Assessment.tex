	This will vary from a few words to two to three sentences depending on the material. This will be to demonstrate your understanding of the course.
	
	\textbf{Do not just repeat answers from your notes without this explanation.}
	Make sure your method of calculation is clearly shown.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item This assessment is made up of \pageref{LastPage} pages.  
		\item \textbf{You must upload your answers viaGradeScope} to Minerva \textbf{within 48 hours of theassessmentbeing released.} You are advised to allow up to four hours to photograph your answers, and upload  as a PDF  toGradeScope. The upload link will be found in the Assessment section for each module on Minerva and will be available throughout the period of the assessment
		\item Although the upload is open for the full period of the assessment, you
		are advised that the assessment should only require 2 hours to complete.
		\item \textbf{Late submission of answers is not possible. }
		\item You must answer \textbf{all} of the questions in this assessment.
		\item You should cross out any work you do not want to be marked. 
		\item You should indicate the final answer to each question by underlining it. 
		\item As part of the process of submitted through GradeScope you must identify
		which questions are answered on which uploaded pages. You must also check
		that you have uploaded all the work you wish to be marked as part of this
		assessment and that the answers uploaded are clearly legible. Failure to do
		so may result in your work not being marked. 
		\item This is a formal University assessment. \textbf{You must not share or
			discuss any aspect of this assessment, your answers or the module more
			generally} with anyone whether a student or not during the period the
		assessment is open.

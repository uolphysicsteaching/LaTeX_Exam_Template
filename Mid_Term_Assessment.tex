%You can just write every question as a separate \item and the numbering will be sorted for you
%You just indicate the number of marks for each question with \ptsmk{xxx}
		
\item 1.	Mid-term papers only have ``Section A'' style questions which should test the breadth of the student’s knowledge from weeks 1 to 5. Each question should be ``standalone'' in that they do not depend on a previous question in order for students to understand what they need to do. Questions should not include unseen problems 
\ptsmk{2}

\item Questions should be worth between 3 and 8 marks and not have multiple parts to them. Wherever possible ensure that students are required to provide eplanation or interpretation of their answer and/or produce some diagram as this makes it significantly easier to demonstrate collusion.
\ptsmk{5}

		\item Try to write the questions as simply as possible and avoid convoluted sentence structures. Avoid setting scenarios that include the student answering the problem – i.e. write “A person is in a balloon when….” and not “You are in a balloon when...
\ptsmk{6}


\item Only use \textbf{bold} for emphasis, do not use \underline{underline} or \textit{italics} or any other textual marks (including in rubric and instructions!)
\ptsmk{4}

\item Text should all be Arial font, 12pt. Try to avoid the use of non-standard symbol fonts where possible as they can cause problems if they do not embed in the pdf correctly. Equations do not need to be sans-serif especially if it makes them less clear e.g. confusion between the digit $1$ and the lower case letter $l$. %By default the TeX template is using serif font in equations.
